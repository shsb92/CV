export const IntroductionText = `
As an ambitious frontend engineer, I have acquired a comprehensive skill set in 
rapid prototyping, web and mobile application engineering, and development. 

During my time as a research assistant at Justus Liebig University, 
I successfully designed and developed the frontend for an integration platform aimed 
at managing researchers' data. This experience allowed me to improve my expertise in 
building robust web software solutions.

Currently, as part of the development team at INFINITT Healthcare ltd., 
I am actively involved in the development of the DoseM product. 
This role has provided me with valuable possibilities to enhance my skills in JavaScript, 
React, and C#. Due to the nature of DoseM as a registered medical product in Germany, it 
necessitated a strong focus on stability and responsiveness to customer feedback. 
This came along with the need to further develop my flexibility in 
adapting to different software development environments.

With a desire to build a solid foundation for my future in Korea, I am looking for opportunities 
to enhance my professional environment.

Driven by a passion for software development I am continuously looking to improve 
my skills and knowledge. I am confident that my background in frontend engineering and 
development, combined with my adaptability and commitment to delivering satisfying results, 
make me a valuable asset in professional settings.`;
